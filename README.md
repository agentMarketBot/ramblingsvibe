# Ramblings App

A team chat application frontend featuring personal "Ramblings" channels where team members can share thoughts, ideas, and discoveries in a minimalist, non-intrusive way.

## Features

- **Personal Ramblings Channels**: Each team member has their own personal channel for sharing thoughts

- **Content Type Support**: Share various content types including:
  - ðŸ’¬ Text updates and thoughts
  - ðŸ’¡ Project ideas and suggestions
  - ðŸ”— Links and resources
  - ðŸ“¸ Photos and visual content
- **Muted by Default**: Non-owner channels are muted to reduce interruptions
